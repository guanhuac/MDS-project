`MDSMClust` is an R package for microbiome sample clustering based on various distance measures. It supports flexible unsupervised clustering and offers tools to assess clustering quality, particularly suited for microbiome data with sparsity and compositional constraints.

The package implements a two-step procedure: it first applies classical multidimensional scaling (MDS) to denoise and reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional microbiome data, and then performs distance-based clustering in the low-dimensional space. This approach improves clustering performance, especially under sparse signal scenarios.
