`MDSMClust` is an R package designed to perform microbiome sample clustering using classical multidimensional scaling (MDS) combined with various ecological and compositional distances. It provides flexible support for both unsupervised clustering and validation of clustering quality, particularly in microbiome data characterized by sparsity and compositionality.
